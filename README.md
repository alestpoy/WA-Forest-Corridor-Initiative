# West African Sustainable Forest Corridor Initiative

## Vision
To establish a transboundary collaborative framework that halts and reverses deforestation across West Africa, ensuring the sustainable management of forest ecosystems, enhancing climate resilience, and securing livelihoods for local communities.

## The Problem
West Africa faces one of the highest deforestation rates globally, driven by agricultural expansion, illegal logging, fuelwood collection, and inadequate enforcement of forest policies. This loss of forest cover threatens biodiversity, disrupts water cycles, exacerbates climate change, and undermines food security and the subsistence of millions of people who depend on forest resources.

## Purpose of This Repository
This repository serves as the **digital command center** for the planning phase of the West African Sustainable Forest Corridor Initiative. It is a transparent, dynamic, and collaborative platform where ministers, NGOs, technical experts, and potential donors can:

- Draft and discuss proposals
- Define political, financial, and technical workstreams
- Track progress through issues and pull requests
- Build consensus on a unified regional action plan

All stakeholders are invited to contribute to the issues, propose solutions, and review documentation. This open‑source approach ensures accountability, inclusivity, and the efficient mobilization of resources.

## How to Contribute
1. **Explore the Issues** – Browse the open issues that outline the key workstreams (political, financial, technical, community‑engagement).
2. **Comment and Discuss** – Share your expertise by commenting on existing issues.
3. **Submit Proposals** – Fork the repository, create a branch, and submit a pull request with a concrete contribution.
4. **Review and Merge** – Participate in the review of pull requests to refine and adopt proposals.

## Structure
- **Issues** – Each issue represents a thematic area that requires input and collaboration.
- **Pull Requests** – Concrete proposals that address specific issues.
- **Documents** – Key documents (e.g., draft charters, funding strategies, technical plans) will be stored as Markdown files in the repository.

## Contact
For high‑level inquiries, please contact the office of the Minister of Forestry, West Africa.
