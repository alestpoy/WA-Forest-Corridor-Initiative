# Labeling System for Workstreams

This repository uses a simple labeling system to categorize contributions and track progress. Labels are applied to each workstream (and, in the future, to GitHub Issues) to facilitate filtering and assignment.

## Available Labels

| Label | Purpose | Example Workstream |
|-------|---------|---------------------|
| `political` | Matters of policy, legislation, governance, and inter‑governmental cooperation | Political & Institutional Framework |
| `financial` | Funding mechanisms, resource mobilization, budgeting, and financial instruments | Financial Mobilization Strategy |
| `technical` | Technology, data systems, monitoring methodologies, and scientific approaches | Technical Implementation Plan |
| `community‑engagement` | Livelihoods, food security, participatory approaches, and social safeguards | Livelihoods & Food Security Integration |
| `transboundary` | Issues that span national borders, requiring regional coordination | All four workstreams |

## How Labels Are Used

1. **Workstream Documents** – Each workstream file in this folder includes a **Labels** line that lists the relevant labels.
2. **GitHub Issues** – When the repository’s Issues feature is activated, the same labels will be applied to the corresponding issues.
3. **Pull Requests** – Contributors can tag their PRs with these labels (via the PR’s description or via GitHub’s label UI) to indicate which workstream the contribution addresses.

## Assignment

The **Assigned** line in each workstream document indicates the hypothetical lead responsible for coordinating that workstream. In a fully operational GitHub project, assignments would be made using GitHub’s assignee feature.

*This labeling system ensures that contributions are easily discoverable and that stakeholders can focus on the areas most relevant to their expertise.*
