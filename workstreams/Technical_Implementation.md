# Technical Implementation Plan

**Status:** Open for contributions  
**Labels:** technical, transboundary  
**Assigned:** tech-lead-efa (hypothetical lead technical expert)

## Objective
Outline a proposal for a unified, community-based forest monitoring system using GIS and remote sensing.

## Background
Effective forest management requires accurate, timely, and transparent data on forest cover, degradation, and restoration progress. A regional monitoring system that integrates satellite imagery, ground‑truthing, and community participation can provide the evidence base for policy decisions and law enforcement.

## Requested Input
We invite GIS specialists, remote‑sensing experts, data scientists, and community‑forestry practitioners to contribute to the design of this system.

## Key Components
- Satellite‑data acquisition and processing pipeline
- Community‑based ground‑truthing protocols
- Data‑sharing platform with open‑access principles
- Capacity‑building modules for local forest rangers and community monitors
- Integration with national forest‑inventory systems

## Deliverable
A detailed technical implementation plan, including architecture diagrams, required hardware/software, cost estimates, and a phased rollout schedule.

## How to Contribute
1. Comment on this file with suggestions for technologies, methodologies, or existing systems that could be adapted.
2. Submit pull requests with draft sections of the plan.
3. Volunteer to lead specific components (coordination via the repository’s discussion features).
