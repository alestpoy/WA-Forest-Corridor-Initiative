# Political & Institutional Framework

**Status:** Open for contributions  
**Labels:** political, transboundary  
**Assigned:** (to be assigned)

## Objective
Propose a draft charter for regional cooperation on forest management and law enforcement.

## Background
Deforestation in West Africa is a transboundary challenge that requires coordinated policies, shared enforcement mechanisms, and harmonized legislation. A regional charter will establish common principles, commitments, and governance structures.

## Requested Input
We invite ministers, legal experts, and policy advisors to contribute to the drafting of this charter. Key elements to address include:
- Principles of sovereignty and shared responsibility
- Mechanisms for cross‑border law enforcement and information sharing
- Institutional arrangements (e.g., a permanent regional forest commission)
- Dispute‑resolution procedures
- Monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) frameworks

## Deliverable
A final draft charter ready for adoption at the next ministerial meeting.

## How to Contribute
1. Comment on this file (or create a discussion in the repository’s Issues section once established).
2. Submit a pull request with a complete draft document.
3. Review and discuss contributions.
