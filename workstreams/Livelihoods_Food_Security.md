# Livelihoods & Food Security Integration

**Status:** Open for contributions  
**Labels:** community-engagement, transboundary  
**Assigned:** (to be assigned)

## Objective
Draft guidelines for promoting sustainable agroforestry and non‑timber forest products to support local communities.

## Background
Forests are vital for food security, nutrition, and income generation for millions of people in West Africa. Integrating sustainable livelihood practices into forest‑corridor management ensures that conservation efforts also improve human well‑being and reduce pressure on forest resources.

## Requested Input
We invite agroforestry specialists, community‑development practitioners, nutrition experts, and representatives of forest‑dependent communities to contribute to these guidelines.

## Key Themes
- Agroforestry systems that combine food crops, fodder, and timber species
- Sustainable harvesting and value‑addition of non‑timber forest products (NTFPs)
- Market linkages and fair‑trade certification for forest‑based products
- Gender‑sensitive approaches that empower women and youth
- Conflict‑resolution mechanisms between conservation and livelihood needs

## Deliverable
A practical set of guidelines, including case studies, best‑practice checklists, and training materials for extension workers and community organizations.

## How to Contribute
1. Share existing guidelines, case studies, or success stories from the region.
2. Propose specific agroforestry models or NTFP value chains suitable for West African ecosystems.
3. Submit pull requests with draft sections of the guidelines.
